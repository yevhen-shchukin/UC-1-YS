User
I have .NET API endpoint written in C#:

[HttpGet]
	public async Task<IActionResult> Get(
		string? nameFilter,
		int? populationMaxFilter,
		string? sortByNameAscendOrDescend,
		int? maxCount)
	{
		var response = await _httpClient.GetAsync(_apiUrl);

		if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
		{
			var countries = await response.Content.ReadAsAsync<List<Country>>();

			if (nameFilter != null)
			{
				countries = _countriesBl.FilterByName(countries, nameFilter);
			}

			if (populationMaxFilter != null && populationMaxFilter > 0)
			{
				countries = _countriesBl.FilterByPopulation(countries, (int)populationMaxFilter);
			}

			if (Enum.TryParse(sortByNameAscendOrDescend, true, out SortAscDesc ad))
			{
				countries = _countriesBl.SortByName(countries, ad);
			}

			if (maxCount != null && maxCount > 0)
			{
				countries = _countriesBl.GetRecordsNumber(countries, (int)maxCount);
			}

			return Ok(countries);
		}
		else
		{
			return StatusCode((int)response.StatusCode);
		}
	}

Please document it

Sure! Here's a documentation for the provided .NET API endpoint written in C#:

Get Method Endpoint
Description
This endpoint allows you to retrieve a list of countries based on optional filters and sorting parameters.

HTTP Method
GET

Endpoint
bash
Copy code
/api/endpoint
Request Parameters
The endpoint accepts the following query parameters:

nameFilter (optional): A string used to filter countries by name.
populationMaxFilter (optional): An integer used to filter countries by maximum population.
sortByNameAscendOrDescend (optional): A string indicating the sorting order of the countries by name. Possible values are "ascend" and "descend".
maxCount (optional): An integer specifying the maximum number of countries to return.
Response
The endpoint returns an HTTP response with the following possible status codes:

200 OK: The request was successful, and the response body contains a list of countries based on the applied filters and sorting parameters.
Other status codes: The request encountered an error. The status code corresponds to the error that occurred.
If the request is successful, the response body will contain a JSON array of country objects. Each country object has the following properties:

name: The name of the country.
population: The population of the country.
Examples
Request
bash
Copy code
GET /api/endpoint?nameFilter=United&populationMaxFilter=100000000&sortByNameAscendOrDescend=ascend&maxCount=10
Response
css
Copy code
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

[
  {
    "name": "United States",
    "population": 331002651
  },
  {
    "name": "United Kingdom",
    "population": 67886011
  },
  {
    "name": "United Arab Emirates",
    "population": 9890400
  },
  ...
]
Implementation Notes
The endpoint uses an HTTP client (_httpClient) to make an asynchronous GET request to an external API (_apiUrl) to retrieve a list of countries.
The response from the external API is checked for success. If successful, the response body is deserialized into a list of Country objects.
Optional filters and sorting parameters are applied to the list of countries based on the provided query parameters.
The _countriesBl object is used to perform filtering and sorting operations on the list of countries.
The resulting list of countries is returned as the response if the request is successful.
If the request encounters an error, the corresponding HTTP status code is returned.
Please note that this documentation assumes the existence of the _httpClient, _apiUrl, _countriesBl, Country, and SortAscDesc objects or classes, which are not explicitly provided in the code snippet.

### Implementation Notes

- The endpoint uses an HTTP client (`_httpClient`) to make an asynchronous GET request to an external API (`_apiUrl`) to retrieve a list of countries.
- The response from the external API is checked for success. If successful, the response body is deserialized into a list of `Country` objects.
- Optional filters and sorting parameters are applied to the list of countries based on the provided query parameters.
- The `_countriesBl` object is used to perform filtering and sorting operations on the list of countries.
- The resulting list of countries is returned as the response if the request is successful.
- If the request encounters an error, the corresponding HTTP status code is returned.

Please note that this documentation assumes the existence of the `_httpClient`, `_apiUrl`, `_countriesBl`, `Country`, and `SortAscDesc` objects or classes, which are not explicitly provided in the code snippet.
