- sonarcloud.io asks me to insert "your clean build command". What it should be for .NET web api?

- To perform a clean build for a .NET Web API project on SonarCloud, you can use the following command:

Copy code
dotnet clean && dotnet build
This command consists of two parts:

dotnet clean: This command cleans the output directories and removes all intermediate build files. It ensures that the project is built from scratch without any artifacts from previous builds.

dotnet build: This command builds the .NET Web API project. It compiles the source code, resolves dependencies, and generates the necessary output files.

By combining both commands with the && operator, you can execute them sequentially. This approach ensures that the project is cleaned before initiating the build process.

Make sure you run this command in the root directory of your .NET Web API project.
